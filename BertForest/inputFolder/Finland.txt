Finland has a forest cover rate of 76%, making it one of the countries with the highest forest coverage in the world, as well as one of the most developed in forestry. The advancement of Finland's forestry industry owes much to its unique environmental advantages, as well as to scientific management and professional technical guidance. It is the "five modernizations" of forestry that keep this country at the forefront of the world.

Professional Specialization in Forestry Work
Despite most of Finland's forests being privately owned, the degree of specialization is very high. The government exercises macro-control over forest management. Forest management associations provide nursery, forest cultivation, timber harvesting, and sales guidance for forest owners; specialized companies manage seedling cultivation and timber processing; a comprehensive forest certification system and forestry big data companies support forestry production and monitoring; forestry universities and research institutions provide in-depth research and technical guidance. These refined specializations provide a solid foundation for the development of Finnish forestry.

Public Rights to Forest Environments
In Finland, the law grants the public the right to enjoy forest environments. Regardless of whether the forest land is public or private, the public has the right to enter, pick berries and mushrooms, and engage in recreational walking without needing the landowner's consent. Additionally, national forest parks and nature reserves are open to the public for free. This enables public sharing of forest benefits, aligning the goals and interests of the government, private forest owners, and the public, which is beneficial for the joint protection and development of forestry.

Mechanization of Forestry Production
The level of mechanization in Finnish forestry production is high, with processes such as seeding, nursery, planting, logging, and processing mostly performed by machines. The mechanization of forestry significantly improves production efficiency and reduces labor costs, providing a guarantee for the vigorous development of forestry.

Naturalization of Forestry Management
In forestry production, besides harvesting logs and energy materials, other materials like branches, windfall, and standing dead trees are left in the forest. Even when building forest roads that cross streams, the natural state of the stream is maintained as much as possible. Partially rehabilitated state-owned forests are restored to their pre-rehabilitation state; the use of fertilizers and pesticides is extremely cautious, almost eliminating their use. The scientific concepts and methods of close-to-nature management provide a theoretical basis for sustainable forest development.

Popularization of Forestry Knowledge
Finland's national forest parks and nature centers are open to the public for free, equipped with promotional videos, brochures, and interactive experiences, actively educating the public about forestry. In the process of formulating forestry policies and constructing recreational facilities like forest parks, Finland actively seeks and adopts public opinions. The popularization of forestry knowledge plays a crucial role in raising public awareness of forest protection.
The sustainability assessment of Finnish forests is conducted using a set of Pan-European indicators. In some cases, national indicators may be added due to variations in geography, climate, or phytogeography, or some Pan-European indicators may be modified to better adapt to national conditions.

The six Pan-European sustainability standards for forestry are:

Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of forest resources and their contribution to global carbon cycles.

Maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality.

Maintenance and enhancement of forest productive functions, including timber and non-timber resources.

Conservation, maintenance, and appropriate enhancement of forest ecosystem biodiversity.

Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of protective functions of forest resources, primarily soil and water.

Maintenance of other socio-economic functions and conditions.
