Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the forestry and grassland system in China has comprehensively strengthened ecological protection and restoration. Efforts have been made to advance national land greening, improve forest quality, carry out the construction of forest cities, and build national parks. These efforts have made significant contributions to the construction of an ecological civilization, the decisive battle against poverty, and the comprehensive victory in building a moderately prosperous society, ushering in a new stage of integrated development of forestry, grassland, and national parks.

Section 1: Development Environment

Achievements of the "13th Five-Year Plan": The main tasks of the "13th Five-Year Plan" have been completed, binding indicators have been successfully achieved, and the ecological condition has improved significantly. The forest coverage rate reached 23.04%, forest stock volume 175.6 billion cubic meters, comprehensive vegetation coverage of grasslands 56.1%, wetland protection rate 52%, and 150 million mu of desertified land treated.

Significant Achievements in National Land Greening: A total of 748 million mu of afforestation and grass planting were completed, and the area and stock of forests have maintained "double growth" for 30 consecutive years. Key projects such as the Three-North Shelterbelt, natural forest protection, conversion of cropland to forest and grassland, returning grazing land to grassland, and Beijing-Tianjin sand source control have been deeply implemented. The initiative of voluntary tree planting was widely carried out, adding 98 new national forest cities.

A Continuously Improving Protection System: The pilot tasks of the national park system were completed, and the integration and optimization of natural protected areas were steadily advanced. Four new World Natural Heritages and eight World Geoparks were added, and the numbers of more than 300 endangered wildlife species have stabilized or increased. The commercial logging of natural forests has been completely stopped, providing rest and rejuvenation for 1.944 billion mu of natural forests. The annual forest fire damage rate has been controlled below 0.9â€°. The revisions of the "Forest Law of the People's Republic of China" and the "Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China" have been completed.

Steady Growth of the Forestry and Grass Industry: The total output value exceeded 8 trillion yuan, forming three pillar industries - economic forests, timber processing, and forest tourism - each with an annual output value of over one trillion yuan. China leads the world in forest product production and trade, with the value of foreign trade in forest products reaching 160 billion USD. Ecological poverty alleviation has shown remarkable results, and measures like ecological compensation, national land greening, and ecological industries have lifted more than 20 million people out of poverty. A total of 1.102 million impoverished people have been employed as ecological forest rangers, and 23,000 professional cooperatives for poverty alleviation through afforestation and grass planting have been established, benefiting over 16 million poor people in industries like camellia oil.

Continued Deepening of Reform and Opening Up: The reform tasks of state-owned forest regions and state-owned forest farms have been completed. The reform of the collective forest rights system has been steadily advanced, and the number of administrative licensing approval items has been gradually reduced. Eighteen achievements were awarded the second prize of the National Science and Technology Progress Award. China successfully hosted the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification and the 2019 Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition.

Development Opportunities:

The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core attaches great importance to the construction of ecological civilization, which is placed in a prominent position in the overall work, and a series of fundamental, pioneering, and long-term tasks have been carried out. Ecological civilization construction has undergone historic, turning-point, and comprehensive changes from understanding to practice.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" proposal of the Central Committee and the "Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan" of the state require enhancing the quality and stability of the ecosystem and promoting the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. Based on the new development stage, implementing the new development concept, and building a new development pattern, forestry and grass industries face new development opportunities.
Xi Jinping's ecological civilization thought provides the goal and direction for the forestry and grass industries. General Secretary Xi Jinping, standing at the strategic overall situation of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and sustainable development, attaches great importance to the forestry and grassland national park undertakings, making a series of important instructions and discussions, providing fundamental followings and action guides for the protection and development of forestry and grass. It is necessary to adhere to the systematic concept, promote integrated protection and restoration, play a foundational and strategic role in maintaining national ecological security and promoting ecological civilization construction, consolidate and expand the achievements of ecological poverty alleviation, and effectively connect with rural revitalization, laying the ecological foundation for comprehensively building a modern socialist country.
The goals of peaking carbon emissions and carbon neutrality provide significant opportunities for forestry and grass construction. With carbon peaking and carbon neutrality incorporated into the overall layout of economic and social development and ecological civilization construction, it is imperative to unswervingly follow the high-quality development path of ecological priority and green low-carbon, increase forest areas, improve forest quality, enhance the carbon sink increment of the ecosystem, establish and improve the value realization mechanism of ecological products, and make greater contributions to achieving China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals and maintaining global ecological security.
Scientific greening provides a follow-up for the high-quality development of forestry and grass. Forestry construction is a fundamental issue concerning the sustainable development of the economy and society. It is necessary to follow the path of scientific, ecological, and thrifty greening development, implement greening space on the unified map of the national land "three surveys" results, and carry out large-scale national land greening actions according to local conditions and differentiated strategies.
The optimization of the natural protected areas system with national parks as the main body has optimized the national land spatial layout. The top-level design of the natural protected areas system with national parks as the main body is continuously perfected. It is necessary to speed up the establishment of national parks, protect the original truthfulness and integrity of the ecosystem, steadily advance the integration and optimization of nature reserves and natural parks, effectively protect the most important parts of China's natural ecosystem, the most unique natural landscape, the most essence of natural heritage, and the most concentrated biodiversity, and leave precious natural heritage for future generations.
The comprehensive implementation of the forest chief system has consolidated the institutional foundation for the protection and development of forestry and grass. The comprehensive implementation of the forest chief system is a major innovation in the forest and grass supervision system and governance system. It is necessary to further consolidate the primary responsibility of local party committees and governments at all levels for the protection and development of forest and grass resources, and establish a long-term mechanism of party and government joint responsibility, territorial responsibility, departmental coordination, source governance, and full coverage.
Facing Challenges: China's total amount of forest and grass resources is insufficient, the quality is not high, and the carrying capacity is not strong, with an unstable ecosystem. The management of the mountain-water-forest-farmland-lake-grass-sand system is not in place. The natural conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas in the west and north are harsh, making national land greening difficult. There are risks and hidden dangers of forest and grassland fires, pine wood nematode disease, and the invasion of alien species, and it is difficult to consolidate achievements. The reform of forestry and grass needs to be deepened, and the law enforcement system and grassroots team are weakened. The policy support system is not perfect, and the mechanism for the realization of the value of ecological products has not been established. Scientific and technological innovation and technical equipment are lagging behind.
